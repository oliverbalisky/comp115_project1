Turtle Drawing - Visible Light

This drawing was inspired by a moment I had while at a Greatful Dead cover band concert, last weekend. As the musicians on stage played their instruments and filled the theatre with music, I leaned back in my seat and stared up at the ceiling light above me. I could see the colors of the rainbow held in the warm white light of the humble pot light that was shining down on me, and, for a moment, was remined of the beautiful mystery that I am a part of.
