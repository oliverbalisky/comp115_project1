Turtle Drawing - Visible Light

This drawing was inspired by a moment I had while at a Greatful Dead cover band concert, last weekend. As the musicians on stage played their instruments and filled the theatre with music, I leaned back in my seat and stared up at the ceiling light above me. I could see the colors of the rainbow held in the warm white light of the humble pot light that was shining down on me, and, for a moment, was remined of the beautiful mystery that I am a part of. 

There are two  main functions in the Turtle Drawing. The first, "drawCeilingLight", draws the yellow/white ceiling light circle, and sets up the large white lined circles in each of the corners of the screen. The second function, "drawLightRays", calls on a series of other functions, which ultimatley creates light coming from the ceiling light. This function uses squares that are rotated at slightly differnet angles, and assinged the colours of the rainbow to create the refracted rainbow rays. Then each of the rainbow rays are rotated around the centre point of the light to give the cool design. From a single square in the smallest function, the longest distance from corner to corner of the square is calculateed using pythagorean theorum, and this hypotenuse is used as the side for the next ring of squares, and so on and so forth. Most of the functions use "for loops" to eliminate unnecesary repeating code.
